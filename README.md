# Azure Static Web App as UI for TypeChat

This is a simple experiment to add an UI for [TypeChat](https://microsoft.github.io/TypeChat/)

There is a textbox to enter your natural language prompt, a button to invoke the API (for know I took only the CoffeeShop example)
and another box the shows the strongly typed json result.
